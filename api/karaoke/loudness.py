"""Loudness matching of a separated stem to the song it came from.

Taking the vocals out takes much of a song's energy with them, so the
accompaniment comes out several dB quieter than the song. Played after the
original, or after another karaoke track, it sounds like the volume dropped.

The stem is scaled by a single gain, so its dynamics are left as the separation
made them. ffmpeg measures both files, since it reads any song a user uploads,
and soundfile rewrites the stem, since it keeps the stem's format and bit depth.
